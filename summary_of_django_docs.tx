- Including other URLconfs


from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("community/", include("aggregator.urls")),
    path("contact/", include("contact.urls")),
]

- django takes the url that matches the above address, chops the first part, and sends the rest to the included urlconf for further processing

skipping ...

- URL namespaces

url namespaces can have two parts
    application namespace
    instance namespace

instance namespaces should be unique across the entire project.

namespaced urls are specified using the : operator.
example: admin:index -> namespace of admin, and a named url of index

namespaces can be nested.
example: sports:polls:index (look for named url of index in namespace of polls which it itself is defined in the top level namespace of sports)

- Reversing namespaced urls

consider polls:index
1. django will look for application namespace which here is polls
2. current application will be polls, the url resolver will be returned,
    current_app arguemnt in reverse() function
    can be accessed with request.current_app
3, 4, 5 ...
this process is continued until a view is reached.

this is complicated as hell...
